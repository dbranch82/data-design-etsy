			daily use.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Mike is ready to take his small hobby and make it into a revenue generator. He

		<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Mike is looking to make money whilst doing something he enjoys. </p>
		<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I need to see if this site will be the appropriate place to sell my goods
		and if it will allow me to give my customers a unique experience.</p>

		<h2><strong>Use Case</strong></h2>
		<p>Mike has been looking at different websites where people can sell handmade goods.</p>
		<p>Mikes biggest sticking point is giving his customers the option of customization and also being able to show his past work.</p>
		<p>It is Thursday and Mike needs to be able to get his site up in under 30 minutes during his lunch break as he already
		has people wanting to order. The weekend is fast approaching.</p>
